# October Frontend Challenge - Tic Tac Toe

![Design preview for the Tic Tac Toe coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Getting Started
- Fork this repository
- In your fork, create a new branch called `october-challenge`
- Do your work in this branch and create a PR to _your_ master branch
- Send me the PR link

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Tic Tac Toe game and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Since it's October, feel free to add additional themes to the board and show off your creativity!

For this challenge, I would like you to use React to build out the funtionality. I've included the Create React App scaffolding in this repo. To learn how to start/stop/build, read the CRA-README.md instructions.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo (for now)
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that itâ€™s preserved if the player refreshes their browser

### Expected behaviour

- For the start screen, you can omit the New Game (vs CPU.)
- On the new game screen, whichever mark isn't selected for the first player is automatically assigned to the second player when the game is started.
- The first turn of the first round is always played by whoever is playing as X. For every following round, the first turn alternates between O and X.
- After a round, if the player chooses to quit the game, they should be taken back to the new game menu.
- If the restart icon in the top right is clicked, the "Restart game?" modal should show and allow the player to reset the game or cancel and continue to play.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. You can find the .fig file in the `design` folder. The design download also comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/public/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project. Our fonts always come from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
